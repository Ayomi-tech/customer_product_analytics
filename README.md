# Customer & Product Analytics

This repository serves as a centralized hub for data modeling across payment systems and product lifecycle management. It leverages modern data engineering stacks to transform raw data into actionable insights

## Repository Overview

This repository is structured into two primary modeling projects, each utilizing a specialized tech stack tailored for its data source:

1. **customer_payment_modeling:** This project focuses on the financial layer, transforming customer payment transactions into analytical models. 
Core Tech: dbt (data build tool) & SQL.
Focus: Modular SQL modeling, automated testing, and documentation of payment workflows.

2. **product_medallion_core:** This project implements a Medallion Architecture to process and refine product-related data at scale. 
Core Tech: Databricks, Apache Spark (PySpark & Spark SQL), Delta Lake, and Unity Catalog.
Focus: End-to-end data engineering pipelines, schema enforcement, and centralized data governance.

**Getting Started**
Each project contains its own detailed README.md with specific setup instructions, environment requirements, and execution steps. Please navigate to the respective directory to learn more.
